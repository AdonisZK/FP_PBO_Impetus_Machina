## About
Impetus Machina is a **Side-Scrolling Platformer** game about an advanced combat android. You play as the android girl named Iris made by the evil hands of power hungry diplomats that was thrown away for its dysfunctional system and inability for following order. Iris waking up in the junkyard, with little memory of oneself and no drive Iris moves for the sake of surviving, a feeling an android shouldn't have (human's conscience). With only a crowbar in hand Iris needs to find a reason to live and the meaning of her existence. On her journey Iris will find people and things she truly care about. 'Till Iris found the one thing only she could do for the sake of humanity.

## About
This final project is a game called Impetus Machina
Its a game about an advamced combat android made from the evil hands of power hungry diplomats that was thrown away for its dysfunctional system and inability for
following order. you play as the android girl, waking up in the junkyard of a floating island, with little memory of oneself and no drive she moves for the sake of 
surviving, a feeling an android shouldnt have. with only a crowbar in hand she needs to find a reason to live and the meaning of her existence. On her journey she will 
find people and things she trulyr care about. till she found the one thing only she can do for the sake of which she found precious.

In this game we have multiple features like doublejump, currency which isnt usable right now, multiple levels etc.
